# RISC-V-SoC_tapeout-program-Week-0 (Task-0)
This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week. "In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative

## 📅 Week 0( Task-0)  — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [**Task 0**] | 🛠️ [Tools Installation](Task-0/README.md) — Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **gtkWave** | ✅ Completed |



### 🌟 Key Learnings – Week 0

Successfully installed and verified the required open-source EDA tools.

Gained understanding of the basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.

Prepared the system to begin RTL → GDSII flow experiments in the upcoming sessions.

##🙏 Acknowledgment
