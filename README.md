# gowtham_RISC-V-SoC_tapeout-program-Week-0
This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.  "In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative
## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [**Task 0**](Week0/Task0/README.md) | 🛠️ [Tools Installation](Week0/Task0/README.md) — Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **gtkWave** | ✅ Completed |



### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.


## 🙏 Acknowledgment
